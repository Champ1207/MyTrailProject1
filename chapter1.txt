This The First Test file which i am going to upload on the git and learn to use git usage.

A point to remember that to open a file using cmd MacOS uses the keyword open whereas in windows to that operation we use the "start" keyword.


To initiate a git commit we use the command "git init".
To get the status of the project files we use the command "git status".
Then to add the projects files to change statuts log we use the command "git add .". "." is used to represent that all files are to be selected.
To add an operational email to the git we use the command ' git config --global user.email "Our email address" '.
To add an operational username to the git we use the command '  git config --global user.name "Our username" '.

Then to commit our project to git we use the command ' git commit -m "Message to be given for the recognition of the commits" '.
To check the commit activities that we do we use the command as " git log ".
